      <h2>Ads and Financing</h2>

        increased load. Please disable your ad blocker on CSTOOL.io to support open source software.</p>

      We also use Amazon CloudFront. This is a web service that allows static and dynamic web content such as HTML, CSS,
      .js and image files to be delivered to users faster. CloudFront delivers the content through a worldwide network
      of data centers called edge sites. When content is requested from CloudFront, it is routed to the least latency
      (delay) Edge site, so that the content is delivered with the best possible performance. To do this, your IP
      address is sent to AWS Amazon Web Services, Inc. (410 Terry Avenue North, Seattle WA 98109, United States). AWS
      participates in the EU-US Privacy Shield program.
